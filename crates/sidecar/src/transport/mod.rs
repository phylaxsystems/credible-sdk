//! # `transport`
//!
//! The transport module provides abstractions for communication between the sidecar and external
//! transaction sources (e.g., sequencers, builders, or test harnesses).
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The sidecar operates as a listener-based system where external drivers send transactions and
//! block envs that drive the core engine to build blocks and validate assertions.
//! Transports act as the bridge between these external systems and the internal engine.
//!

/// The `Transport` trait defines the interface for external communication adapters that
/// forward transactions and block environments to the core engine.
///
/// A transport should be implemented when implementing a new communication interface
/// between the sidecar and driver (or sequencer). A transport should be entirely self contained
/// spawning all services it needs to communicate inside of itself. The only way it should
/// interact with the rest of the sidecar code is via the `TransactionQueueSender` passed to
/// the driver on creation. The transport will be spawned alongside other components of the
/// sidecar and work alongside them.
///
/// The main transport task *should not* block. If the transport needs to block it is
/// recommended to spawn a new blocking task for whatever action that blocks is needed.
///
/// ## Associated Types
///
/// - `Error`: Transport-specific error type for connection and protocol failures
/// - `Config`: Configuration type for transport initialization
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// 1. **Creation**: Use `new()` with configuration and queue sender, called whenever a new transport is created (generally on startup)
/// 2. **Execution**: Call `run()` to start the transport
/// 3. **Shutdown**: Call `stop()` for graceful cleanup
///
/// ## Communicating with the driver
///
/// The transport should have 2-way communication with the driver:
/// - to receive transactions,
/// - to query for missing state.
///
/// The transport should have an endpoint to receive transactions/blockenvs from the driver
/// it then converts to events it can send to the core engine.
///
/// If the core engine runs into state it does not have cached locally, it should query it via
/// the transport, which should query the driver and store the response into the sidecar cache.
///
/// ### Querying and storing state; Communicating with engine
///
/// ***TODO: expand docs on interacting with state when implementing the state mod***
///
/// ## Erroring
///
/// The `Error` type defined in the trait should be used for exiting the transport when it
/// encounters an error it cannot trivially recover from. The sidecar is designed to recover
/// from individual component crashes, so if the transport exits with an error, it will attempt
/// to restart it.
